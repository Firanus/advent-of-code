# 2017 - Day 2

Nothing too complicated in this one. Could make Part 2 more efficient by breaking out of the loop earlier, but the problem space is so small it's not worth the code.

## Part 1

To solve Part 1, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2017/02-corruption-checksum/part1/index.js
```

## Part 2

To solve Part 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2017/02-corruption-checksum/part2/index.js
```
