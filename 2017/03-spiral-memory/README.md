# 2017 - Day 3

[https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/3](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/3)

Slightly weird problem this one in that you can use maths to solve Part 1 more efficiently, but that same approach forces you to do Part 2 from scratch. Still, all in all, pretty approachable.

## Part 1

To solve Part 1, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2017/03-spiral-memory/part1/index.js
```

## Part 2

To solve Part 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2017/03-spiral-memory/part2/index.js
```
