[https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/5](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/5)

Not a tricky one, but the first where breaking out seperate code for each
solution felt excessive. So the run instructions are a little more complex.

## Part 1

To solve Part 1:

1. Go into `index.js` and make sure the code marked as "Code for Part 1" is uncommented, and the "Code for Part 2" is commented out.

2. Run the command below from the project root.

```sh
node node 2017/05-twisty-trampoline-maze/index.js
```

## Part 2

To solve Part 2:

1. Go into `index.js` and make sure the code marked as "Code for Part 1" is commented out, and the "Code for Part 2" is uncommented.

2. Run the command below from the project root.

```sh
node node 2017/05-twisty-trampoline-maze/index.js
```
