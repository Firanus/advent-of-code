# 2017 - Day 7

This problem was all about tree traversal, so I whipped out TypeScript to get to the bottom of it.

Thought for a little while about experimenting with data viz on the tree itself, but dropped the idea when I realised that (a) it would take more time to visualise the tree than to solve the problem by a looooooong way, and (b) at this size of tree, visualization ultimately wouldn't be that useful, particularly when part 1 (finding the root), is so easy to find algorithmically.

To solve both parts, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2017/07-recursive-circus/index.js
```
