# 2017 - Day 11

This problem is based around navigating a hex grid. What fun!

Not having much experience with hex grids, I used
[this article by Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)
to figure out how I should handle the coordinate system. There's a more detailed
comment in the code.

To solve both parts, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2017/11-hex-ed/index.ts
```
