# 2017 - Day 12

This problem is about breaking a set up into groups depending on the links between them.
I'm sure I've seen something like it before, but can't place it at the moment. In any case,
it wasn't that hard a one to solve.

To solve both parts, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2017/12-digital-plumber/index.js
```
