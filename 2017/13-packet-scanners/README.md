# 2017 - Day 13

This problem isn't too bad. You're making your way across a grid of moving scanners. I'm sure
you could do it with a game simulation, but their movement was elementary enough that you could just
do it with some maths, which I did.

To solve both parts, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2017/13-packet-scanners/index.js
```
