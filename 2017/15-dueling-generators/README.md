# 2017 - Day 14

This problem is ultimately a random number generator. So while it was elementary
to code out, it's also stuck at like 40s to run, which feels unreasonably slow.
Figuring out why it's so slow and optimising it doesn't feel like it should be hard,
and would possibly be some nice learning.
