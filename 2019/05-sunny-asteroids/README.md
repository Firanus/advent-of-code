# 2019 - Day 5

The second of the VM problems, and one which made me refactor the entire computer
I'd built. Can't imagine doing this with time pressure during the challenge.

We actually did some interesting stuff here as well, including adding parameters
modes to the computer, and a half dozen instructions covering comparisons, input,
output and jump commands. This is quickly becoming functional.

To solve both parts, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2019/05-sunny-asteroids/index.ts
```
