# 2019 - Day 6

This problem ended up being about constructing a graph, and then running different
versions of Djikstra to minimum distances.

In Part 1, we calculate minimum distances from a point called COM, and summing them.

In Part 2, we calculate the minimum distance from a point called YOU, and reporting
the distance from that point to a point called SAN (-2, for story reasons).

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2019/06-universal-orbit-map/index.js
```
