# 2019 - Day 8

[https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8)

A relatively straightforward problem about taking an input of "layered pixels" and using
it to construct an image. Fun to visualise, and not too challenging.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2019/08-space-image-format/index.ts
```
