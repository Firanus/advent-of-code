# 2022 - Day 4

A problem about seeing if groups overlapped. I solved it using sets to
calculate intersections. There were neater ways that just involved comparing
numbers, but given performance wasn't a concern, this worked perfectly well.
Alse, everyone solved yesterday's problem using sets, so it was nice to get involved.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2022/04-camp-cleanup/index.js
```
