# 2022 - Day 5

Hardest part of this problem by far was just parsing the initial input
programmatically. I ended up doing this in a slightly cheeky way that
only works because the input is well-formed. I'm happy with it though. :)

I broke this one into two parts because the most elegant stack solution
involves mutating the arrays, so it was easier to just have two solutions.

To solve Part 1, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/05-supply-stacks/part1/index.ts
```

To solve Part 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/05-supply-stacks/part2/index.ts
```
