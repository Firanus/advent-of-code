# 2022 - Day 8

A fun little problem that's actually very similar to the skylines problem
we once asked at interview. Essentially, you have a grid of heights, and
you have to see if (a) a given point is visible to someone outside the grid
and (b) what you can see from that point looking out.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2022/08-treetop-tree-house/index.js
```
