# 2022 - Day 9

[https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9)

An interesting problem about rope movement. Quite enjoyed it, even though I
did get myself into a tizzy at the end trying to debug my code. A cleaner
approach to writing the movement code probably would have saved me an age.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/09-rope-bridge/index.ts
```
