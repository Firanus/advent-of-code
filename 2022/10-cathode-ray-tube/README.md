A fun little problem that finishes with you drawing on the screen, which I
always enjoy. :) Also bears some resemblence to 2019 in that you're thinking
about computer registers again, though in a much simpler way than with the full
IntCode computer.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/10-cathode-ray-tube/index.ts
```
