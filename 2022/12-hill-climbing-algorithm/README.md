And we've finally reached that point in 2022 where we introduce pathfinding!
Overall, pretty simple problem. Solved it with a relatively straightforward
application of Djikstra's Algorithm.

I then went and changed it to use the A\* Search algorithm. The performance
difference was minimal here, but I wanted to have a go. :)

To solve Part 1, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/12-hill-climbing-algorithm/part1/index.ts
```

To solve Part 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/12-hill-climbing-algorithm/part2/index.ts
```
