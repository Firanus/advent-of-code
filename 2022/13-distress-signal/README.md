# 2022 - Day 13

Really enjoyed this problem, which is mostly about parsing a recursive type and
writing a comparison function for that type. Interesting problem, and by some good
fortune I got the comparison logic right first time, which felt badass. :D

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/13-distress-signal/index.ts
```
