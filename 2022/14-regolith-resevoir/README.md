# 2022 - Day 14

A fun problem! All about working around obstacles to fill a space with sand
that descends vertically. Nothing too conceptually complex here, just a lot
of stuff to write and see how you go. And the final results are quite pretty!

They change the parameters of the space in Part 2, so I just broke it out into
its own code for ease of access. :)

To solve Part 1, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/14-regolith-resevoir/part1/index.ts
```

To solve Part 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/14-regolith-resevoir/part2/index.ts
```
