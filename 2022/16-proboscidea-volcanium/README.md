# 2022 - Day 16

This problem was awful. Absolutely fucking awful

Ultimately, it's trying to ask you to do a graph traversal, but the problem
is that the values you're trying to optimise for vary with each step around
the grid, which makes it hella hard to solve.

I managed to eventually pull something out with a solution that probably took
about 30 minutes on Part 2, that I left running while trying to optimise further.
This code is currently in a half-working state, because at that point I was about
10 hours in, it was almost midnight, and I was just so done.

TODO: Finish improving the upper limit optimization to see if you can reduce the
runtime to something not awful.

Code doesn't work at the moment, but once the TODO above is done, we can optimise
to get it functioning better.
