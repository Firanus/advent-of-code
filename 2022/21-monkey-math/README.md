# 2022 - Day 21

[https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/21](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/21)

Fun problem today. Part 1 was some fairly simple tree building and recursion.
Part 2 involved you having to think a little to deconstruct the tree. Ultimately,
nothing too complex in there. :)

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/21-monkey-math/index.ts
```
