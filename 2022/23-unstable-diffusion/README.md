# 2022 - Day 23

Interesting problem today. We're essentially simulating diffusion of particles
on a 2D grid. There's a fair amount of weirdness that doesn't translate to, e.g.
air particles, but it's pretty cool nonetheless watching the grid expand.

Pleased today that I saw Part 2 coming, so I only had a 1 minute delta time between
part 1 and part 2. :)

Also, the visualisations were cool, so I left them in when you run the program. :)

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/23-unstable-diffusion/index.ts
```
