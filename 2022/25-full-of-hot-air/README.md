# 2022 - Day 25

And with that, another year comes to an end. What a pleasure it was!

This last problem, in the tradition of last problems, was pretty easy going.
It's essentially about translating numbers to and from a number system called
"balanced quinary", which is essentially a base 5 number system with -2,-1,0,
1 and 2 as its digits, rather than 0,1,2,3,4. Figuring out the from calculation
took just a little thinking, but nothing too much.

I was the 1110th completer over all this year, which I will take. Fun and games! :)

To solve part 1 (the only part today!), run the following from the project root:
