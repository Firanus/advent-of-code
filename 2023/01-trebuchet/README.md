# 2023 - Day 1

[https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

Back to the races, with a vague goal of not letting Luke Storry win.
Unfortunately, today I was unsuccessful, though his input data didn't have any
gotchas, so screw him. :P

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
node 2023/01-trebuchet/index.js
```
