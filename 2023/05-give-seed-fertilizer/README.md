# 2023 - Day 5

Good Lord this felt like a jump in difficulty. Ultimately, this was just
intersections, but part 2 intersections on ranges was fairly miserable. I think
a solid TDD framework would have helped here, though I did actually write some
test code that I've left in, but commented out.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023\05-give-seed-fertilizer\index.ts
```
