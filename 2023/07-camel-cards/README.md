# 2023 - Day 7

[https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)

My highest ever ranking on the leaderboard for Part 1 today, 758! I got the initial
parsing down fast (Though co-pilot definitely helped me in writing out some of
the basic cruft here). Unfortunately, made a mistake in Part 2, so dropped down to
2571 for the whole day. Still my best result ever I believe. Woop!

As for the problem itself, conceptually not too bad; essentially parsing and ranking
simplified poker hands. Part 2 introduced Jokers and it took me a bit to figure out
how best to handle them, and ran into bugs. Still, overall very happy.

Because of rule changes, split out Part 1 and Part 2 today.

To solve Part 1, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/07-camel-cards/part1.ts
```

To solve Part 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2022/07-camel-cards/part2.ts
```
