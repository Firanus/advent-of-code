# 2023 - Day 9

Huh. Today was just straight up pretty easy. Part 1 involved generating
some sequences from rules, and it just worked quite nicely. Part 2 was just
adding a value to the start rather than the end. 3 lines of code to get the
answer there. Nice!

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023/09-mirage-maintenance/index.ts
```
