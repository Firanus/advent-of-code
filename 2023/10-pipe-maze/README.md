# 2023 - Day 10

If I'm being honest, I'm a little self-conscious about today. Part 2 really threw me for
a loop, and I wasn't sure what to do with it. So I checked the solutions for hints.

Ultimately, the correct solution was something quite simple. You have to floodfill a grid,
but you can move between pipes. The right move is to just increase the resolution on the
grid. I saw someone suggest it, and then coded it out. This is all well and good, and I'm
ok with how I got there, but I think we've hit the point where 5AM is becoming unfeasible.
I want to actually solve these problems, and it feels juuuuuust a touch like I cheated today.
Honestly, I wouldn't care, but Luke Storry actually work up to try the problem today, and I feel
bad taking the points off him. Oops.

Mostly though, it's just a really cool problem! I need to give myself more space to enjoy it next
weekend. Lesson learned. :)

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023/10-pipe-maze/index.ts
```
