# 2023 - Day 12

First one I haven't solved in one go. Frankly I'm looking forward to giving up the
5AM slot. I had no idea how to do this efficiently this morning. The idea came
to me after about 2 hours, but I needed sleep. Managed to find some time in a
busy day to come back to it, but phwoar. Got there though!

For later, this is definitely an optimisation.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023/12/index.ts
```
