# 2023 - Day 13

Huh, funny one. Expected to need to do something clever in part 2, and actually
this was a case where brute forcing took almost no time to complete. Wonder what
trick I missed.

There was a little nuance in part 2 in making sure you were getting the right
reflection index, but got there with a little debugging.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023/13-point-of-incidence/index.ts
```
