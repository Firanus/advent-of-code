# 2023 - Day 18

Today I learned the shoelace formula! What fun!

It's a way of calculating the area inside a shape using determinants if you
have the shape of it's perimeter, which is honestly pretty delightful. Glad
to add it to the knowledge base.

For part 1, I also went an entirely different way, which gave me a chance
to use the parity trick I learned about in Day 10. Bit of nuance handling
bottom edges, but overall, also a lot of fun. Good day for learning this!
Hence, kept the code for that around.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023/18-lavaduct-lagoon/index.ts
```
