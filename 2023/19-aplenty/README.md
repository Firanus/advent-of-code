# 2023 - Day 19

Today, we had a fairly nuanced little bit of parsing, followed by what was
essentially navigating a linked list or tree-ish structure. Started out fine
but Part 2 made it a little more interesting bu having to navigate all possible
routes.

Wrote myself a little recursive function, and was pleasantly shocked when it
worked first time. Thank goodness; debugging that would have been no fun!

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023/19-aplenty/index.ts
```
