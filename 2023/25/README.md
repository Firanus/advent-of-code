# 2023 - Day 25

This one was kind of a lot for day 25 to be honest. We're trying to seperate
one graph into two graphs combined by only the lightest of inputs. While this
is all well and good, the theories and utter tiredness made this hard.

The code here is a mess, and I haven't cleared it up. One of the future.

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2023/25/index.ts
```
