# 2024 - Day 7

Our first recursive problem of the year! How exciting.

Luckily, I got this one pretty much first try. I'm quite happy with how
my solution came out, and I got it nice and fast, which is delightful for
my ego. Huzzah!

To solve both parts 1 and 2, run the following from the project root:

```sh
npx ts-node 2024/07-bridge-repair
