# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), as well as other interesting problems.

This repository originally consisted of solutions to just the problems of Advent of Code 2021. I've since generalised it a bit to serve as a repo for all the Advent of Code problems I decide to tackle. I doubt I'll complete them all, but who knows, I might. Til then, we'll use this.

In general, the philosophy of this repo is that each problem is self-contained. This is there to let me play with a bunch of languages, and run them independentally. At the moment, the languages are JS and Swift, though we may well introduce others.

For the problems themselves, our approach is very much "just get something that works", rather than go for absolutely optimal time. Having said that, when I'm not doing this under the hammer of "a problem a day, every day", I might well experiment with looking for more optimal solutions.

So far, years I've tackled:

- [2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) - In progress
- [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) - **Complete**
