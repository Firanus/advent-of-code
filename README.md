# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

The design philosophy here is very much "just get something that works", but I'm also not trying to get to the solutions with unprecedented pace. So I've let myself play around with languages a bit and generally follow the fun. So far, that's let me whip out my old Swift, which has been a delight. :)
